1. create a vpc
2. create a multi subnets
frontend_subnets[]
backend_subnets[]
mysql_subnets[]
3.get availability zones and add to the subnets
4.peer connection between two vpc id's
5.create a route table for all subnets
frontend_route_table
subnet_route_table
db_route_table

7.create an internet gateway for internet(it is just like plug)
8. create a nat gateway
9.create an eip
10.get connection for public subnets from internet gateway
10.1 associate between route table id and private subnets
11.get connection for nat gateway from public subnets
12.get connection for private subnets from nat gateway
13. add security group to an instance
14.edit default route table id and add another means custom vpc id and peer connection to allow traffic
